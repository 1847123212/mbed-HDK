## CI Test Shield
The CI Test Shield has two parts

	1. Hardware - physical board with sensors and wiring to hook pins together. The hardware design files can be found in this repo as part of the mbed HDK. 
	2. Software - tests that use the hardware. The software can be found in the [CI Test Shield github repository](http://www.github.com/armmbed/ci-test-shield). 

## How to get hardware

1. Buy pre-assembled board from vendor (todo)
2. Do it yourself, order [PCB from OSHPark](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/aOdUcwq7) and parts from the BOM. You can either use the BOM in this folder or order from an [eBOM on OctoPart](https://octopart.com/bom-tool/ZgvU783O).


## How to use the software
For full instructions on how to use the software see the [github page](https://www.github.com/armmbed/ci-test-shield).
