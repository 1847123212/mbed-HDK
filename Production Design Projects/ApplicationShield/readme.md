## Application Shield

The Application Shield includes an array of connectivity, sensors and display options to enable the maximum number of potential experiments with Arduino form factor mbed development boards.

## Whats included here?

* Eagle Schematic and Board files
* PDF Schematic and Board copies
* CAM Job GERBERS for manufacture (including pick/place and drill)
* BOM (Bill of Materials) In .csv or eBOM

## Hardware

The hardware design files can be found in this repo as part of the mbed HDK. The design features:

        1. 128x32 Graphics LCD
        2. 5 way joystick
        3. 2 x Potentiometers
        4. Speaker, PWM Conencted
        5. 3 Axis +/1 1.5g Accelerometer
        6. RGB LED, PWM connected
        7. Temperature sensor
        8. Socket for for Xbee (Zigbee) or RN-XV (Wifi)
