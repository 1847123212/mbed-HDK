# mbed HDK

The mbed Hardware Development Kit (mbed HDK) is a collection of hardware design resources that have been gathered to assist in the development of custom hardware benefiting from the mbed ecosystem, such as mbed OS, mbed SDK and associated technologies such as DAPLink. Working with development boards that were based on the mbed HDK is the most efficient way to get started with the mbed platform.

The mbed HDK provides:

* Eagle Schematic and Board files
* PDF Schematic and Board copies
* CAM Job GERBERS for manufacture (including pick/place and drill)
* BOM (Bill of Materials)
* eBOM (An online BOM for easy purchasing!)

## Whats included here?

- CAD resources in Eagle 7.3.0 format
    - mbed-HDK component library
    - Design rules
    - CAM jobs
    - User Language Program (ULP) scripts for Eagle 7.3.0

- Production Design Projects 
    - mbed Application Shield

    - CI Test Shield
    - DAPLink
       - SWDAP LPC11U35
       - DAPLink LPC11U35

Production Design Projects include projects of the mbed-HDK which have been manufactured and that fulfil a specific use case. Each Production Design Projects is referenced by their most up-to-date version v’x.x.x’. (If you wish to find an older project version, navigate to releases or checkout a previous commit).

Please keep in mind that the resources are provided "as is". Though best efforts have been made to ensure the highest possible quality, no support or guarantees can be offered. The latest versions of Production Designs contained in the mbed-HDK have been successfully manufactured by a third-party manufacturer and proven to work.
