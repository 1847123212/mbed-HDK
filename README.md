# mbed HDK

The mbed Hardware Development Kit (mbed HDK) is a collection of hardware design resources that have been gathered to assist in the development of custom hardware benefiting from the mbed ecosystem, such as mbed OS, mbed SDK and associated technologies such as DAPLink. Working with development boards that were based on the mbed HDK is the most efficient way to get started with the mbed platform.

This release includes:

- CAD resources in Eagle 7.3.0 format
    - mbed-HDK component library
    - Design rules
    - CAM jobs
    - User Language Program (ULP) scripts for Eagle 7.3.0

- Production Design Projects

    - CI Test Shield
    - DAPLink
       - SWDAP LPC11U35
       - DAPLink LPC11U35

- Bare Design Projects 
    - To be added

Production Design Projects include projects of the mbed-HDK which have been manufactured and that fulfil a specific use case.

Bare Design Projects include a starting point of simple schematic & board resources to develop using the mbed-HDK from the ground up. 

Please keep in mind that the resources are provided "as is". Though best efforts have been made to ensure the highest possible quality, no support or guarantees can be offered. The latest versions of Production Designs contained in the mbed-HDK have been successfully manufactured by a third-party manufacturer and proven to work.
